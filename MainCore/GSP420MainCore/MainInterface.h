	//-----UI-----
	//Animation. Still figuring out how to work with render core, Studio is freaking out because of Direct X libraries not being set up right for me.

    //access to the physics constants: drag, gravity, and friction. Accessible as public constants.
    //a means of binding keys to an action
    //a way to create and position a button, then assign an action to that button. Will figure this out better when I figure out rendering core better
    //a means of opening a window (debug or console) for output. Besides interacting with the console directly, you can call the OutputToConsole method to output to the console.
    //a means of querying active NPCs //Array of worldObjects, including NPCs. May make an NPC class that inherits from WorldObject.
    //a means of locating a specific NPC //That NPC's array number.
    //a means of moving a specific NPC //Changing the x,y,z values for that NPC.
